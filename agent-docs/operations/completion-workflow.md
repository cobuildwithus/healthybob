# Completion Workflow

Last verified: 2026-03-13

## Sequence

1. Complete functional implementation first.
2. Run simplification pass using `agent-docs/prompts/simplify.md`.
3. Apply behavior-preserving simplifications.
4. Run test-coverage audit using `agent-docs/prompts/test-coverage-audit.md`.
5. Implement the highest-impact missing tests identified by the coverage pass when a real test harness exists.
6. Re-run required checks after simplify + coverage updates.
7. Run final completion audit using `agent-docs/prompts/task-finish-review.md`.
8. Resolve high-severity findings before final handoff.
9. Final handoff must report required-check results; green required checks remain the default completion bar.
10. If a required check fails for a credibly unrelated pre-existing reason, commit your exact touched files and hand off with the failing command, failing target, and why your diff did not cause it. If you cannot defend that separation, treat the failure as blocking.

## Coordination Ledger (Always Required)

- Before coding work, add an active row to `agent-docs/exec-plans/active/COORDINATION_LEDGER.md`.
- Treat the row as an active-work notice by default, not a hard lock.
- Overlap is allowed when agents stay within their declared scope, read the current file state first, and preserve adjacent edits.
- Mark a row as exclusive in `Notes` only when overlap is unsafe, such as a broad refactor or a delicate cross-cutting rewrite.
- Update the row if file scope, symbol intent, or exclusivity expectations change.
- Remove the row immediately when the task is complete or abandoned.

## Audit Handoff Packet

When using a fresh subagent for coverage or completion audits, provide:

- What changed and why (behavior-level summary).
- Invariants/assumptions that must still hold.
- Links to active execution plans (when present).
- Verification evidence already run (commands + outcomes).
- Current worktree context and explicit review boundaries.
- Instruction to read `COORDINATION_LEDGER.md`, honor any explicit exclusive/refactor notes, and otherwise work carefully on top of overlapping rows.

## Safety Rules

- Do not overwrite, discard, or revert unrelated worktree edits.
- Do not use reset/checkout cleanup commands to prepare audit passes.
- If an audit suggestion conflicts with pre-existing edits, leave the file untouched and escalate in handoff notes.
